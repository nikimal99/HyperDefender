# HyperDefender
Welcome to the official repository for our paper **"HyperDefender: A Hybrid Framework Safeguarding GNNs for Hyperbolic Space"** accepted for publication at AAAI 2025!. This repository includes the code and data used in our experiments.

# Paper
Thank you for visiting! You can access the preprint of our paper here.

# Highlights
Our framework is designed to achieve the following:

- Evaluating the vulnerability of GNNs and Hy-GNNs to poisoning and evasion attacks, showing that neither standalone Hy-GNNs nor Euclidean defenses can effectively counter adversarial challenges in hierarchical datasets.

- Analyzing Gromov Î´-hyperbolicity to understand how adversarial attacks disrupt the hierarchy in graph networks.

- Presenting HyperDefender, a flexible framework that combines Euclidean defenses to develop robust hyperbolic methods, restoring hierarchical integrity and resisting adversarial attacks.

- Benchmarking HyperDefender's performance under adversarial conditions in node classification tasks, demonstrating its superiority over existing Euclidean defense models.


## Installation

### Step 1: Unzip the Attacks Folder

Unzip the `attacks.zip` folder included in the repository.

### Step 2: Set Up the Environment

1. Create a fresh Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n hyp_def python=3.8.10
   conda activate hyp_def
   ```

2. Install the required versions of `torch` and `torch_geometric`:
   ```bash
   pip install torch==2.0.0 torchvision==0.15.1 torchaudio==2.0.1
   ```
   *The above command installs PyTorch with CPU support only.*

3. Install PyTorch Geometric:
   ```bash
   pip install torch_geometric
   pip install pyg_lib torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.0.0+cpu.html
   ```

4. Install other dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorly fvcore tabulate numba deeprobust
   ```
